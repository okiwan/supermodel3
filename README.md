# Supermodel3

Just a fork from the original [Super Model 3 emulator](http://www.supermodel3.com/), prepared to be compiled on "modern" OSX systems. Also added some default configurations in the Config folder, NV RAM states and some basic scripts to compile and prepar a distribution folder for the executable.

### Requirements

* SDL2
* zlib

Both of them recommended to be installed via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

### Getting ready

Go to the *Scripts* folder and execute the **dist.sh** script. Should be that easy. As a result, you will find a *dist* folder in the root with all the basics ready to be executed. Of course to enjoy the experience you will need some additional...stuff...you know what I mean, right?
