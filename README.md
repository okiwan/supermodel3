# Supermodel3

Just a fork from the origin Super Model 3 emulator, prepared to be compiled on OSX systems. Also added some default configurations in the Config folder, NV RAM states and some basic scripts to compile and prepara a distribution folder for the executable.

All credit goes to Bart Trzynadlowski and his amazing team.
